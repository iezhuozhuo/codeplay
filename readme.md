# Make Coding Great Again!

The purpose of this REPO is to build our code library. All code based on Baidu but we add various available components, and we will update it constantly. These useful components and modules can help us quickly deploy the model and accomplish tasks. The final code library is the **source**.

**source**: used to implement all the algorithms you want to implement.

**example**: use source implement Text Classifier/Name Entity Recognition etc ...

**temple**: quickly build model pipeline what you want.

~~**code_utils**: it will be deleted in future.~~
